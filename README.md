You never change something by fighting the existing reality. To
change something, build a new model that makes the existing model
obsolete â€” Buckminster Fuller 

## Name
   M_overload(3f) - a module of intrinsic and operator overloads
   (LICENSE:MIT)
## Synopsis
```text
       use M_overload
```
## Description

   A WIP (Work In Progress)

   Common examples of intrinsic and operator overloads available
   as an fpm(1) package.

## Building the Module using make(1) ![gmake](docs/images/gnu.gif)
     git clone https://github.com/urbanjost/M_overload.git
     cd M_overload/src
     # change Makefile if not using one of the listed compilers
     
     # for gfortran
     make clean
     make F90=gfortran gfortran
     
     # for ifort
     make clean
     make F90=ifort ifort

     # for nvfortran
     make clean
     make F90=nvfortran nvfortran

This will compile the Fortran module and basic example
program that exercise the routine.

## Build and Test with FPM ![-](docs/images/fpm_logo.gif)

   Alternatively, download the github repository and build it with
   fpm ( as described at [Fortran Package Manager](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) )

   ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/urbanjost/M_overload.git
        cd M_overload
        fpm run "*"
        fpm run --example "*"
        fpm test
   ```

   or just list it as a dependency in your fpm.toml project file.

```toml
        [dependencies]
        M_overload        = { git = "https://github.com/urbanjost/M_overload.git" }
```
